# RAG Chatbot with Flowise

A smart **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** built using **Flowise** that allows users to upload documents and ask context-aware questions. The chatbot retrieves relevant document chunks using **Google Gemini Embeddings** and generates accurate answers with **Mistral AI**.

---

 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **document-based conversational AI system** using the RAG architecture in Flowise. It processes uploaded documents, converts them into embeddings, stores them in a vector store, and uses an LLM to answer user queries based on retrieved context.

 Features

- Upload and analyze documents
- Context-aware question answering
- Semantic document retrieval using embeddings
- Maintains chat history using memory
- Fast retrieval with in-memory vector storage
- Built visually using Flowise nodes

 Technologies Used

- **Flowise**
- **Google Gemini Embeddings**
- **Mistral AI**
- **Recursive Character Text Splitter**
- **File Loader**
- **In-Memory Vector Store**
- **Buffer Memory**
- **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**

---

 Workflow

The chatbot flow includes the following components:

1. **Recursive Character Text Splitter**
   - Splits the document into smaller chunks
   - Chunk Size: `1000`
   - Chunk Overlap: `200`

2. **File Loader**
   - Loads the source document into the workflow

3. **Google Gemini Embeddings**
   - Model: `gemini-embedding-001`
   - Task Type: `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`

4. **In-Memory Vector Store**
   - Stores document embeddings for retrieval
   - Top K: `4`

5. **Mistral AI**
   - Model: `mistral-tiny`
   - Temperature: `0.9`

6. **Buffer Memory**
   - Stores previous conversation context

7. **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**
   - Combines retriever, memory, and language model
   - Produces context-based answers

 How It Works

1. A document is uploaded using the **File Loader**
2. The text is split into chunks using the **Recursive Character Text Splitter**
3. Each chunk is converted into embeddings using **Google Gemini Embeddings**
4. Embeddings are stored in the **In-Memory Vector Store**
5. When the user asks a question:
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector store
   - Mistral AI generates a response using retrieved context
   - Buffer Memory maintains the conversation flow
